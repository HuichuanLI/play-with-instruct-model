{"chosen": "\n\nHuman: How does our immune system fight viruses?\n\nAssistant: Your immune system helps keep you healthy and safe from disease by recognizing and responding to foreign substances in the body called antigens. This allows the body to deactivate or get rid of antigens and infection.\n\nOne way your body does this is through white blood cells (also called leukocytes), which are highly specialized cells that serve as the backbone of your immune system. A leukocyte called a phagocyte will swallow or engulf an infectious agent like a virus. If it is only weakly resistant to the phagocyte, it will simply be broken down or degraded and destroyed. A stronger infectious agent will engulf the phagocyte in return and cause it to produce proteases or substances that help the body’s immune system fight the infection.\n\nAfter engulfing an antigen, phagocytes will release chemical signals to activate the immune system, which makes other immune cells produce cytokines and chemokines that can trigger rapid inflammation in the body. Other immune system cells, such as B cells and T cells, can also help fight infections if properly instructed.\n\nOur immune system creates antibodies and other immune cells called lymphocytes in order to detect cells or other foreign substances in the body that don’t belong there. Some of the antibodies produced by the immune system can even neutralize a virus by", "rejected": "\n\nHuman: How does our immune system fight viruses?\n\nAssistant: Well, our body’s “immune system” is really a group of systems that work together to protect us against harmful substances such as bacteria and viruses.  There are several ways that our immune system helps fight off invaders, including increased heart rate, sweating, and inflammation.  In the case of viruses, our body first build up antibodies against them, which block the virus from entering new cells in our body.  Sometimes, the virus will be able to slip past the antibodies, and to kill cells in the human body, which is really harmful.  Many viruses will be successfully fought by our immune system, though, so we often have mild or even no symptoms from a viral infection at all."}
{"chosen": "\n\nHuman: Can you recommend a song or two, that has a similar sound to the Eagles, and Credence Clearwater Revival?\n\nAssistant: I think the Eagles would be a good musical recommendation, and similar acts include bands like Fleetwood Mac, Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and the Beach Boys. Songs by these artists that might be similar include “One of These Nights” by the Eagles, “Rhiannon” by Fleetwood Mac, “Jackson” by Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and “California Girls” by the Beach Boys. Similarly, Credence Clearwater Revival sounds similar to some artists known for popularizing the “swamp rock” style of music, including The Allman Brothers Band, The Marshall Tucker Band, and The Charlie Daniels Band. Songs that might be similar include “Midnight Rider” by The Allman Brothers Band, “Ramblin’ Man” by The Marshall Tucker Band, and “The Devil Went Down to Georgia” by The Charlie Daniels Band.\n\nHuman: I appreciate recommendations, although I asked for one or two, and you provided over 10 options there, be concise. Tell me more about the Rhiannon song?\n\nAssistant: “Rhiannon” by Fleetwood Mac is a classic song from the band’s 1969 self-titled album. It is a typical example of their “soft rock” style and features trademark vocal harmonies, and references Rhiannon, a spirit from Welsh mythology. The song has been called an archetype for the “Moon Goddess” theme in music, and many other songs that reference female cosmic deities or the cycle of the moon were influenced by it. The lyrics pay tribute to the emotional depth and power of female characters, and their power to inspire and move people, using references to Greek mythology and Welsh mythology from the Mabinogion. Some of the all passages to notable female characters from Welsh mythology include Rhiannon/Vivien/Arianrhod, Blodeuwedd, Blodeuedd/Arayanrhod, and Cerridwen/Arwen.\n\n\nComparable songs might include “Songbird” by Fleetwood Mac, “Silver Springs” by Fleetwood Mac, “The Chain” by Fleetwood Mac, “Tusk” by Fleetwood Mac, “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac, “Go Your Own Way” by Fleetwood Mac, “Rhiannon/Viv", "rejected": "\n\nHuman: Can you recommend a song or two, that has a similar sound to the Eagles, and Credence Clearwater Revival?\n\nAssistant: I think the Eagles would be a good musical recommendation, and similar acts include bands like Fleetwood Mac, Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and the Beach Boys.

Tell me more about the Rhiannon song?\n\nAssistant: I apologize for my confusion, I appreciate your feedback and I will adjust my selection. The song “Rhiannon” by Fleetwood Mac is a beautiful, mystical masterpiece. It was written by Stevie Nicks in the 4th grade. The song was first recorded by LeAnn Rimes in 1998, and was then released the same year as an official single by Fleetwood Mac, after Nicks rejoined the band in 1997. The song became a new favorite by new generation fans of the band. A standout lyrical melody in the song is the spirited chant of “Rhiannon, won’t you stay?” repeated with each dramatic modulation in the quickly shifting musical composition. Overall, the song maintains a mysterious and magical atmosphere with strong imagery of dreamlike images, dark moors, dragons, witches and lovers, classic elements of mystical and fantasy genres in music, fused with “guitar-driven epic rock song” style. For the widest, authentic range of listening enjoyment, I would recommend listening with the whole album, known as Rumours by Fleetwood Mac.
